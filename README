## Implementation of Tropological Sort

Idk why people often complecate the procedure, just do it da simple way, isnt it?

```` java

List<Node> list = new GraphWay()
              .needs(5, 4, 2, 3, 0, 1)
              .add(5, 2)
              .add(5, 0)
              .add(4, 0)
              .add(4, 0)
              .add(4, 1)
              .add(2, 3)
              .add(3, 1)
              .get();
      TopologicalSort sort = new TopologicalSort(list.size(), list);
      Object[] sorted = sort.start();
      System.out.println(Arrays.toString(sorted));
      
      // prints [5, 4, 2, 3, 1, 0]

There can be more than one valid outputs for the same trees.
Also I've refered many sources to test the Algorithm i wrote
